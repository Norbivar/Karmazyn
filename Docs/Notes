Notes:
- _impl.cpp : template function definitions

Map:
	Definitely a 1D vector (simulated 2D) of some sorts, to instantly access individual tiles.	
	This could need an API to use (built up with a member vector), with both a [][] operator, or a function to get (x, y) tile.

	- seed 
	- modifications done to certain tiles (so that we don't save the entire map, only the seed and what changed)
	- size (WIDTH + HEIGHT)
