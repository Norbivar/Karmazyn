A tile-based, isometric hobby project of mine, where the idea is to have a random generated world, with different medieval cities in it, and simulate
some sort of economy between them. The player will be a "nobleman", who can decide to join and build up an existing town, or start a new one.

EDIT: at least it wanted to be when I had time to spend on it
